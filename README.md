# 🫁 Lung Cancer Prediction Based on Survey Data

This project predicts the likelihood of lung cancer using machine learning techniques based on survey data. The goal is to identify patterns that may help in early detection using demographic and symptom-related features.


## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Data Preprocessing: Encoding, scaling, and class balancing using SMOTE
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation matrix and class distribution
- ⚖️ Imbalanced Class Handling: SMOTE oversampling
- 🤖 Models Used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- 📈 Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- 📊 Visualization: Confusion matrices and performance bar plots
- 🧪 Custom Prediction: Predict lung cancer risk for new patient input

## 📁 Dataset

- File: `survey_lung_cancer.csv`
- Source: _(Insert dataset source or link here, like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), Google Drive, etc.)_
- Target variable: `LUNG_CANCER` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🧠 How the Models Work

Each model is trained to classify individuals based on their responses to a set of medical and lifestyle-related survey questions. Models are evaluated using standard classification metrics and visualized for comparison.
